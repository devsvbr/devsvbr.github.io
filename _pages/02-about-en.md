The DevSV blog was born in 2010, as a portuguese tech blog hosted at [WordPress](https://devsv.wordpress.com/). It was created by 3 young boys from a brazilian seaside town called SÃ£o Vicente.

The basic idea was simply to write about anything we like... just like bloggers.

After a while blogging at WordPress, we decided to move to our new home at [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). So here we are!
